In this stage we do not have to learn new concepts.
We only create an additional if statement and create the `getNotAllowedCharacters` which is basically the opposite of the `getAllowedCharacters` function from the previous stage.

You may notice that the many nested if statements make it difficult to read and write code.
Also, up to this point the code is written in a more imperative style like you would do if using Python.
However, one of the key differences of Haskell is its functional style.

To get the full benefits of Haskell we have to rewrite the whole application.

In the next stage we are going to learn about:
- `type`, `newtype` and `data` keywords - [Haskell Wiki - Type](https://wiki.haskell.org/Type)
- Recursion as a key concept in Haskell - [Recursion](http://learnyouahaskell.com/recursion)
- Currying - [Haskell Wiki - Currying](https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying)
- How to build functions from smaller functions
- Functors, Applicative Functors and Monads - [Monads and other Functional Structures](https://mmhaskell.com/monads)
- How to write a proper parser for RegEx in Haskell - [Parser Combinators in Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/parser-combinators-in-haskell)
- any many more

This pill will be bit of a hard one to swallow, but you will learn a lot about functional programming in general.
Fortunately, extending your application is going to be a lot easier after the next stage.
