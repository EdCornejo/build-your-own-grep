In this stage we don't have new concepts to learn.
We only created an additional if statement and created the `getNotAllowedCharacters` which is very similar to `getAllowedCharacters` from the previous stage.


The many nested if statements makes it difficult to read and write code.
Also the codes is writte in style how you would do in languages like Python (imperative)
But Haskell is conceptionally different (functional).

To get the benefits from Haskell we have to rewrite the whole application.

In the next stage we are going to learn about:
- `type`, `newtype` and `data` keyword - [Haskell Wiki - Type](https://wiki.haskell.org/Type)
- recursion as a key concept in Haskell - [Recusion](http://learnyouahaskell.com/recursion)
- Currying - [Haskell Wiki - Currying](https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying)
- How to build functions from smaller functions
- Functors, Applicate Functors and Monads - [Monads and other Functional Structures](https://mmhaskell.com/monads)
- How to write a proper parser for RegEx in Haskell - [Parser Combinators in Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/parser-combinators-in-haskell)
- any many more

The next pill will be a hard to swallow.
But after the next stage extending your application is going to be alot easier.
